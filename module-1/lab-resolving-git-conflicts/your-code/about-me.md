Hello! My name is Umberto, I'm 20 years old and study politics in college. 

Let me tell you a little bit about myself. I love reading, especially books about finance, and the financial services industry. I also like sport. I use to play tennis but injured my shoulder. Now, I practice triathlon, but I am new to the sport.

I have a twin sister named Sofia.

I wanted to take a course in data analytics because I believe it will be key for future. Data analytics will undoubtedly help me land a job.
