Hello, my name is Umberto. I am from Madrid, Spain, and I am still in University. I have prior experience coding because I took a few courses in college. I am also familiar with the basics of AI and ML because I read a lot about those topics and how they will affect the general economic, political, and social outlooks.

I am taking this course in data analytics because I think data analytics will be omnipresent in the future. Also, it will give me great insights into AI and ML which will help better understand academic articles on machine learning and more specifically deep learning and neural nets.

After the bootcamp I hope to finish my last year of college and get a job at a top blue chip corporation such as google or amazon. Alternatively I would like to get into the financial services industry or the consulting industry and be able to apply the skills I will have learned with you.
